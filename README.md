#SpringClean.me
SpringClean.me is a [glorified] checklist of tasks people should complete to clean up their digital lives in an attempt to make them more secure from both technicaly hacks and social engineering. It also attemmpts to explain in simple english why and how they should complete the tasks. As the user completes tasks they get some suptle visual feedback to imply they are slowly making their online properties more secure.

It is in its baby stages and I would *love* to see pull requests especially in the form of adding more information to cards, fact checking card info/tips or adding new cards I havnt thought of.
